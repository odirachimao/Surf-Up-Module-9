# Surf-Up-Module-9

## PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This project analyzes the temperature statistics and trends in Oahu, Hawaii for the periods of June and December to determine if running a surf shop and ice cream business will be sustainably operate all year round as opposed to a seasonal business. We first run two separate queries, one for June and the other for December then store the temperatures in a list and convert them to a data frame. Finally we get our summary statistics by using the ‘.describe() method.

## RESULT:

•	The table summarizes and compares the temperature statistics for June and December over time:

•	The chart visualizes the temperature summary for June:

## KEY TAKEAWAYS:

•	The average temperature is approximately 75 degrees Fahrenheit for June and 71 degrees Fahrenheit for December. This represents a -5% decrease in average temperatures from June to December. This shows that both months have a moderate temperature and very little weather fluctuation between the two periods. 

•	The two months both share similar max temperatures with 85 degrees Fahrenheit for June and 83 degrees Fahrenheit for December.

•	December seems to be more variable than those in June given its minimum temperature of 56 degrees Fahrenheit as opposed to 64 degrees Fahrenheit in June. Also, with a higher std deviation of 3.74 for December and the median temperature being more in line with the average, proving this point.  


## SUMMARY:

In conclusion, both months share very similar temperatures in Oahu, Hawaii, although December’s temperature record seems to vary more than those of June. December has a wider range of results making its weather suitable for both surfing and an ice-cream business. 
Additional queries will be necessary to be a more adequate decision. This includes: Precipitation difference between June and December to determine which has more rainy weather. Another analysis that should be conducted will be to compare weather stations as temperatures vary at different locations to narrow in on an optimal location.
